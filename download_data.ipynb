Although priming towards healthier food choice has been explored, little research has beendone on priming towards Healthier Food Choice at a subliminal level. To determine how Working Memory Capacity (WMC) influences consumers to be subliminally primed towards healthier food, this research combines the fields of cognitive research and consumer behaviour. This research proposed that Subliminal Priming positively influences consumersâ\\x80\\x99Healthy Food Choice. More specifically, it hypothesises that WMC has a positive moderating effect on the relationship between Subliminal Priming and Healthy Food Choice, if this is in line with the current goals of the consumer. These hypothesises are tested with the use of anexperiment in which participants conduct a visual spatial test and consequently view an advertising video in which they were subliminally primed with healthy food related words. Subliminal priming effect was measured through the choice between a healthy and unhealthydrink. Data was attained through an online survey and the final sample contained 61 participants. The results partially support the hypotheses, to the level that goal relevance did not predict Healthy Food Choice. This suggests that WMC could enhance the effectSubliminal Priming has Healthy Food Choice, but the results also show that WMC directly affects Healthy Food Choices regardless of priming and goal relevance of the consumer.', 'Faculty': 'UvA', ' Author': 'Lex Wolff', 'Programme': 'FNWI BSc BÃ¨ta-gamma', 'Download': 'http://www.scriptiesonline.uba.uva.nl/document/642795', 'Document type': ' scriptie bachelor', 'Institute/dept.': 'UvA: Instituut voor Interdisciplinaire Studies', 'Keywords': 'Consumer behaviour;  advertisement;  healthy food choice;  working memory capacity;  subliminal priming', 'Year': '2016'}\n"

OLS regression for time-series is used. The dependent variables are the budget deficit as percentage of GDP and the payment on social securities as percentage of GDP. Controlling for other factors, no evidence was found for an increase of the budget deficit or the social security payments during election time. Furthermore, no evidence for a decrease of both dependent variables after elections was found.', 'Faculty': 'Faculty of Economics and Business', 'Document type': ' scriptie bachelor', 'Title': 'Every advantage has its disadvantage : does the right to vote introduce politicians acting selfish to stay in office?'}\n"
